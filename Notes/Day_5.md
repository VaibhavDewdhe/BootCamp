# Position
- static
- relative
- absolute
- sticky
- fixed


## static
- This is the default position for all the elements in the html.

## relative
- When we set the position of any element as relative we can then work with other properties like top, bottom, left and right.

## absolute
- Position absolute works with the immediate parent that has non static position

## fixed
- position fixed works in relation of window size

## sticky
- It also works in relation of window size but can be scrolled above the mentioned limit but can't go below mentioned top, bottom, left or right length.


# display
### There are 5 display properties:
- inline
- block
- inline-block
- flex
- grid

## inline
- the element with the display property as inline only takes the size(width and height) of it's content
- It can't work with css properties like width and height

## block
- the element with the display property as block takes full width of it's parent.

## inline-block
- the element with the display property as inline-block possesses the behaviour of both inline and block. i.e. it takes by default the space of it's content only and allow other elements to be in the same line as itself.
- we can also give width and height manually.

## flex
-
